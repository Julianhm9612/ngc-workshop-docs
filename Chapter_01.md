# Description of our application

Today we will design and develop a simple chat application using [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and the [angularfire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2) library.

Our final application will look something like this:

After this, each of you can proceed with adding their own styles or additional functionalities and information (eg. timestamp, different appearance of messages and usernames, etc.)
