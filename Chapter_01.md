# Chapter 01 - Description of our application

[previous chapter](README.md) <----> [next chapter](Chapter_02.md) | [home](README.md)

Today we will design and develop a simple chat application using [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and the [angularfire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2) library.

Our final application will look something like this:

After this, each of you can proceed with adding their own styles or additional functionalities and information (eg. timestamp, different appearance of messages and usernames, etc.)

## Requirements

This is a chat application, so we will have the following requirements:

1. Different users
2. Some type of authenticating these users
3. A log-in screen
4. A log-out button
5. A place where all the messages appear
6. An input field where we can type our messages
7. Preferably, we could make it responsive, so that we can use it on our mobile phones
8. Also, a place to store all these messages
9. And a way to fetch these messages
