# Getting Real-Time with Firebase and Angular

A workshop delivered by Katerina Skroumpelou at [ngColombia 2018](https://www.ngcolombia.com/).

## Description

The participants of this workshop will work hands on with Firebase in an Angular application.
They will walk along a journey of developing an app with Angular and the real-time magic of Firebase, using the angularfire2 library.
Firebase acts as a backend as a service and takes care of real time synchronization across apps and platforms. The participants will learn about and use the main Firebase modules needed to develop a simple social application. They will use Authentication, cloud storage and the Real-Time database. Best practices about application planning will be discussed, like structuring the data in the API and decisions that need to be made in advance.
At the end of this workshop, each participant will have created and deployed a simple web application.
The workshop needs prior knowledge of web development. Some basic Angular experience is preferable, but not essential. No prior knowledge of Firebase is needed.
The users will need a web-development-friendly laptop (preferably a Unix-based system, or Windows with nodejs and npm installed).
